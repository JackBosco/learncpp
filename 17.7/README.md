# 17.7 Introduction to C Arrays

(Lesson)[https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-c-style-arrays/]

### Goal

Figure out how to use stack-initialized C-style arrays in C++.

I know C. I don't know C++. The more C I can do in C++ the better.

### CODE

I initialize an array that is really a matrix.

Then I print out the values in the matrix as row num * 10 + col num

### Result

Great, I don't have to free the array. C++ has OK parity with C.
