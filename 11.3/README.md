# 11.3 Function Overload Resolution

(Lesson)[https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/function-overload-resolution-and-ambiguous-matches/]

### Goal

Improve understanding of function overload resolution in C++

### CODE

Overload function `add()`, have it print which version I am using.
Test the overload priority for various resolution types.

### Result

Got to test some conversions. 

Int conversions by promotion are super common.

Chars are more int-like than string-like due to ASCII conversion.
